##React Introduction
** Components
    - they are code blocks which create a view
    - 2 types 
        a. Class Based Components
             
        b. Functional Components    
        
 ** States Vs Props 
    - States are the data which is stored in the component for the uses by themselves.
    - States can be created, updated or reset.
        -Class Based component
            -this.state
            -this.setState()
        -Functional Components
            -setState() hook
    - Props are the incoming data to a component
    - Props are object data
    - Props are readonly value

## Lifecycle

        -class Based
            a. Mounting
                - constructor()
                    -> Initilization of the default States
                    -> Props setup
                -render()
                    -> First time call() = Load Skeleton
                - componentDidMount()
                    -> after first render call, this function executes
                    -> we call api for the first Load
                    -> if needed update the states
            b. Updated
                - render()
                    -> this function gets called everytime if any fo the state value gets changed
                - componentDidUpdated()
                    -> after second time render gets call this function always executues on any render call
            c. Unmounting
                -componentWillUnmount()
                    -> this only gets executes when a component is switched with another
