##React Introduction
** Components
    - they are code blocks which create a view
    - 2 types 
        a. Class Based Components
             
        b. Functional Components    
        
 ** States Vs Props 
    - States are the data which is stored in the component for the uses by themselves.
    - States can be created, updated or reset.
        -Class Based component
            -this.state
            -this.setState()

            -setState() hook
    - Props are the incoming data to a component
    - Props are object data
